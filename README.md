First person contemplative puzzle game made during the GGJ 2021 in 48 hours. The theme of the jam was "Lost & Found". We added the diversifier "Starlight : Your game world is inspired by stars and constellations".

This was a first for some members of the team but It went great and we find the result quite good.
